Game Title

Stack Master

Concept

Stack Master is a fast-paced casual game where players drop moving blocks to build the tallest tower possible. Precision is key—any misalignment makes the next block smaller, increasing the difficulty. The goal is simple but addictive: build higher, survive longer, and beat your best score.

Gameplay

A block slides horizontally across the screen.

The player taps to drop it on the stack below.

If the block is perfectly aligned, the tower grows steadily.

If it’s misaligned, the overlapping part gets cut off, making the next block smaller.

The game ends when the block becomes too small to stack.

The objective is to build the tallest possible tower and achieve a high score.

Unique Features

Combo Streaks: Perfect drops in a row trigger glowing “combo” blocks that expand the tower back to normal size.

Power-Ups: Occasional special blocks (slow motion, double-size block, magnet block for auto-align).

Dynamic Difficulty: Speed increases as the tower grows taller.

Different Environments: As you reach milestones, the background changes (city skyline → clouds → space).

Leaderboard & Challenges: Compete with friends and global players for the tallest tower.

Target Audience

Age Group: 8+ (casual, easy to learn but challenging to master).

Ideal for mobile players who enjoy quick, addictive games.

Fans of reflex-based and stacking/precision games.

Art Style & Theme

Minimalist & Vibrant: Bright colors, clean shapes, smooth animations.

Day-to-Night Cycle: Background gradually changes as the tower grows.

Option for skins: change block themes (wooden crates, neon cubes, cakes, skyscraper floors).

Inspiration

Inspired by the stacking mechanic in Stack Tower and arcade classics like Tetris, combined with the addictive simplicity of Flappy Bird.

Goal: Create a meditative yet competitive casual experience.
