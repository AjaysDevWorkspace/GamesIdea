# Game Title
THE LAST DAY

## Concept
In the year 2077, you are jamie fook lannister, a former warrior living through the last days of Earth, which is being consumed by a hive-minded alien species called The targaryens. Your only hope is to reach the  kings landing, a secret evacuation starship. Your journey is a desperate race across three hostile zones: a shattered city, a deadly alien-grown forest, and a barren plain. Along the way, you encounter other survivors and make critical choices that affect your resources and alliances.

## Gameplay
The game features multiple endings based on your decisions. You can escape with your allies on the Ark and start a new journey, or you can get off the planet alone, burdened with a new mission. Alternatively, you can sacrifice your life to save humanity, or your selfish choices can lead to you being assimilated by the targaryens, becoming part of their collective. Every choice you make shapes the final outcome.
