create a detective game where we play as a detective solving mysteries .
the give will be story based where we can see the crime scenes, we can talk to victims and we have 
choices to choose from. Each choice changes the flow of the story. upto this, this is a simple game.
but to make it more interesting, we can add a feature where we can use our text based lines, which will
futher opearated by ai , and ai will help the cast the story according to my line used in crime scenes.
its my choice to set up a scene where i can change the story. its should be my choice where i can take bribe
and help the culprits or to be loyal and run for justice. the game should be more interactive and more 
customisable. there should be a feature where we can interact with past mystery game persons, where i can take
help from , in terms of money, or any political power. There should be a money feature , where every  crime 
solved will reward me some sort of money from govt, and beside the money should be added that is taken from bribe.  
target audience is teens and adults who love mystery and detective stories.
theme must be gore and wild
i got inspired from sherlock holmes and other detective stories.
this should be built on unreal for better graphics and more interactive.
