# Grand Streets: Legacy

# Concept
Grand Streets: Legacy is an open-world action-adventure game set in a sprawling modern city full of ambition, crime, and choices. Players step into the shoes of a street hustler rising through the criminal underworld, where every decision can shape their destiny — from becoming a feared kingpin to walking away and starting anew.

# Gameplay
- Open World Freedom: Drive cars, bikes, boats, and even aircraft across a massive city with dynamic weather and day-night cycles.  
- Main Storyline: A narrative-driven campaign where the protagonist builds their empire by taking over territories, forging alliances, and surviving betrayals.  
- Side Activities: Street racing, hacking, property management, trading, heists, and even legal hustles (like delivery jobs or stock trading).  
- Dynamic World: NPCs live their lives — traffic jams, festivals, police, gangs fighting, and random events.  

Player’s objective is to build wealth, respect, and power.

# Unique Features
- Multiple Protagonists: Switch between 3 characters (a hacker, a street racer, and a cop), each with unique skills and missions.  
- Empire Building: Buy and manage businesses — casinos, nightclubs, tech startups — to generate income and unlock new missions.  
- Advanced AI Police System: Law enforcement adapts to player tactics, using drones, cyber units, and undercover operations.  
- Global Expansion: Missions span not just one city but multiple connected (like a coastal city, desert town, and futuristic metro).  
- Choice & Consequence: Branching missions where loyalty, betrayal, and morality affect the ending.  

# Target Audience
